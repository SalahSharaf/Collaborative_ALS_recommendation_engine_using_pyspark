<br/>

## this a premitive project yet it needs more work to be done completely

## i have used pyspark to clean and wrangle data

## i used pyspark built-in machine learning models to create ALS model with latent features or (Rank) of 50 

<br/>

# future work

<br/>
## there is more yet to be done, we can add more accurate model and that can be done using cross validation

## we can add item weight

## we can add user weight

## we can use deep learning models to do better with accuracy

<br/>

# finally 

## i can say thanks for checking out 

<br/>

# good luck
